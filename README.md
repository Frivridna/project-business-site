# Business Site

This project was done during week 3 in Technigo. I did a business site whilst learning how to do a hero-video, sign-up form and accordion. 

## The problem
I started out by researching different sites that I liked that had one or more of the learning objectives for this week.
Then I sketched a layout on paper for my business site, and another layout in a text document. 

I built the site from top to bottom. And focused mainly on one section at at time (header first, then hero-video, then accordion etc.)

I've asked my teammates and help-channel in Slack, google, Stack overflow and re-watched code classes to solve problems I came across during the way. I did not achieve the entirety of my sketched layout since that would have taken me more time than I had at this point. If I had more time I would have added a slide-down effect when the accordion expands and collapses, as well as fix the .answer bars in mobile view. And re-aligned the form section.
